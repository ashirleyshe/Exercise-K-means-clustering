# Exercise-K-means-clustering
* Use the IRIS dataset for this exercise  
  You may download the IRIS dataset at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris 
* Implement the k-means clustering algorithm  
You are NOT allowed to use the k-means function directly from libraries (sklearn.cluster.Kmeans, scipy.cluster.vq.kmeans)
* Apply k-means clustering on the two features of the IRIS dataset, k=2, 3, 4, 5  
(1) Petal length; (2) Petal width  
You probably need to normalize or scale each feature
